# Summary of my Learnings in Module 8
I this module, I was able to recall some of my Data Manipulation in my DBMS to organize my data within the database. I like how that you can connect sqlite3 and perform T-SQL through a string. In merging dataframes I learned that it is important for me to know the row count of my data. Because there will be times that when I join data, there will be data that will be loss. Furthermore, in merging dataframes, it is also similar to when we are using T-SQL in ssms in our DBMS class but it is different in syntax. Even though that it was difficult to comprehend, I was able to follow along through the procedure and try my best to understand as best as I can. Moreover, I learned in the module to aggregate data by using the .agg() function so that. In the time-based selection and filtering I was able to gain insights on how to get data based on what time I want to get through slicing the data, using the groupby, at_time() method which outputs only at that specific time you put, and between_time is a range of time, and etc.
